;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Display images in terminal Emacs (emacs -nw) using the Kitty graphics
;; protocol with direct placements.
;;
;; Architecture: image data is transmitted once per terminal via `a=t'
;; (stored in the terminal without display).  Overlays reserve blank space
;; in Emacs buffers.  After each redisplay, direct placements (`a=p' with
;; cursor positioning) are emitted via `send-string-to-terminal' at the
;; correct screen positions.  Each placement uses a unique placement ID
;; (`p=PID') so repeated placements replace rather than accumulate.
;;
;; Multiple terminals (emacs --daemon + several `emacsclient -t'): output
;; is routed per window to that window's own terminal, and per-client state
;; (backend, cell size, text-sizing level, and which image ids have been
;; transmitted) lives in terminal parameters, so clients on different
;; terminals - even mixed Kitty and Sixel - render correctly at once.
;; Capability probes run lazily, once per terminal, while it is selected.
;; Inline video (mpv) and the casty browser stream a single byte stream to
;; one fd and are therefore bound to the terminal they were launched on;
;; the same buffer shown on a second client renders only its reserved
;; blank area there.
;;
;; Requires: Kitty >= 0.20.0 (direct placement support).
;; Important: Launch Emacs with TERM=xterm-256color for proper color support.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   (require 'kitty-graphics)
;;   (kitty-graphics-setup)
;;   ;; Then org-mode C-c C-x C-v, image-mode, eww images all work.
;;
;; `kitty-graphics-setup' enables the mode the right way for both plain
;; `emacs -nw' and `emacs --daemon': under a daemon there is no terminal
;; at startup, so it defers enabling to the first `emacsclient -t' frame.
;; For a one-off interactive terminal you can also just call
;; `kitty-graphics-mode' directly.

  register a virtual placement with `a=p,U=1', and write `U+10EEEE'
  cells with row/column diacritics plus an image-id-encoded SGR
  foreground into the area the overlay covers.  Those cells live in
  the multiplexer's character grid as regular text, so window
  switches and buffer scrolling are handled by the multiplexer
  naturally; no ghost survives.  Requires the outer terminal to
  implement the placeholder protocol — verified on kitty.app and

also accept terminal-specific env markers — KITTY_WINDOW_ID /
KITTY_PUBLIC_KEY for kitty, `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR' for Ghostty, etc. —
as evidence that the outer terminal speaks the Kitty protocol.
